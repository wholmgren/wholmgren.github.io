## Use open source most of the time

I use closed software (Mac OS X, BBEdit, Safari/Chrome) to develop some open and some closed software using entirely open source packages.
I am trying to convince collaborators and U of A to open source most of our work.
I doubt that you'll convince me to give up my Mac or BBEdit, but I am open to ideas not named CentOS and emacs.

Below is a partial list of core open source technologies used by our research group.
Most of these technologies are used in production code that is almost always running.
Of course, many of these technologies are themselves built upon other open source technologies.

* Python
* Pandas
* numpy
* IPython
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* MySQL
* CentOS
* ArchLinux
* olinuxino
* bash
* WRF
* netCDF
* d3js
* PVLIB_Python
* git
* Mozilla Firefox
* LaTeX

Below is a partial list of closed source technologies used by our research group.
Only Raspberry Pis are used for real-time operations.

* Windows
* Mac OS X
* BBEdit
* MS Office
* Raspberry Pi
* Google Chrome
* Flash (to be replaced soon with HTML5)
