The models continue to struggle with the placement and strength of the remnants of Odile.  The 18Z NAM was especially bad with the center too far north and also with deep convection around the center.   (below)

The 15Z RAP was better as at 18Z it had the center 50 or so miles farther south.  This may not sound like a large error, but proper placement is critical for the Tucson area.  Hard to say if the wind intensity is correct.  Visible satellite imagery does indicate quite strong winds continuing but there is no deep convection anywhere near the center of circulation.

The 15z WRFGFS (below)continues the trend of the other models with the precip too far to the north.  Tucson has received only around a tenth of an inch, but heavier rain has been present now for a few hours in Cochise county.

As other runs, a heavy band of precipitation occurs from Santa Cruz, far eastern Pima, and into Cochise counties during the night.  Again, this band is likely to be offset slightly to the east with Tucson being spared the heaviest rain.

One interesting development is that it's cleared up somewhat and some heating is taking place.  Tucson is now over 80F and with so much moisture around, it won't take much heating to fire off convection.  That is exactly what has happened in the Phoenix area, which I neglected to mention earlier as the 12Z forecast skew-t for that area had some CAPE and well mixed PBL.
